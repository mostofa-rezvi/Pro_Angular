I work in hospital management system project, now I need help in component relationship. 
Dcotor can edit, add, view, delete appointment component.
Doctor appointment model is: 
export class AppointmentDocModel {
  id!: number;
  patientId!: number;
  patientName!: string;
  doctorId!: number;
  appointmentDate!: string;
  reason!: string;
  status!: string;
}

Now I need same crud part for nurse, receptionist, and patient can do only add, view appointment.
